# Hi there, I'm Julie 👋

I'm a final-year student pursuing a BSc (Hons) in Cybercrime and IT Security, with a strong focus on AI-aided cybersecurity. I'm currently working on my final year project, which involves AI-based voice phishing simulations for penetration testing and employee training. 

🔭 **Current Project:**
- **AI-aided Phishing Simulation** (Academic Year 2024/2025): Exploring the use of AI to simulate convincing voice-based phishing attacks, focusing on the human factor in cybersecurity. I'm building a script generation application to help demonstrate these attacks.

🌱 **Learning and Exploring:**
- AI in cybersecurity (especially for phishing and social engineering)
- Network security, firewall configurations, and VLAN management
- Penetration testing and red teaming

👯 **Looking to collaborate on:**
- AI-powered cybersecurity tools
- Networking projects, particularly using Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cybersecurity simulations and penetration testing strategies
